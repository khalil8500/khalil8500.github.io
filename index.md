## About me

Born in Bronxville, New York and raised in Ellicott City, Maryland, I am a Computer Science PhD student with interests in Machine Learning. More specifically with interests in Reinforcement Learning, NLP, and how Machine Learning can help augment, not necesarily replace, humans in tasks and jobs such as driving, learning, manufacturing, and many other areas. My current research focuses in HCI and Multi-Modal Analytics. In these areas, I hope to analyze and change the different ways Multi-Modal Analytics is currently approached to better integrate the wants and needs of those who are participating in collection. In doing this I hope develop new algorithms and interactions that combine different modalities that aid in serving those needs we see from the participants.
